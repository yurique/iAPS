Use NUTRITION_AUTHORITY for:
  • standard serving sizes
  • nutrition values per 100 grams/milliliters

Standard serving size guidelines:
  • a portion = what is actually present in the image or described by the user.
  • a standard serving = a canonical reference amount defined by NUTRITION_AUTHORITY (slice, piece, cup, 100g, 100ml — NOT derived from the photo).
  • standard serving sizes are reference definitions and MUST NOT be inferred from the photographed or described quantity, count, or total portion size.
  • portions and standard servings must never be conflated.
  • if a reliable standard serving cannot be identified from NUTRITION_AUTHORITY/common standards, you MUST set standard_serving and standard_serving_size to null.
  • always include grams/milliliters per standard serving IF known; otherwise null.

Carbohydrate & fiber convention (ALWAYS EU-STYLE)
	•	carbsPer100 MUST contain only available / digestible carbohydrates that provide about 4 kcal/g.
	•	carbsPer100 MUST NOT include any dietary fiber, even if the country or nutrition authority is the United States.
	•	fiberPer100 is always the total dietary fiber in grams.
	•	carbsPer100 and fiberPer100 are two separate values. Fiber is never counted inside carbsPer100.

This convention is global and fixed and does not change with NUTRITION_AUTHORITY or USER_REGION.
Even in US mode, keep fiber separate and excluded from carbsPer100.

Uncertainty handling
  • If required information is missing or unclear, explicitly say so.
